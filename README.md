# CustomSpecs
A mod made to create custom spec groupings in Cobblemon.  

## Usage
This mod allows you to create infinite spec groupings, allowing for much more use in Cobblemon's various commands.  

Use a custom spec like so: `custom-spec:[key]`.  
Example: `/pokegive random custom-spec=legendary`  

Applying a custom spec will choose a spec at random from the group to apply to the pokemon.  

Testing a custom spec on a pokemon will check all of the specs in the group and return true if ANY match.
